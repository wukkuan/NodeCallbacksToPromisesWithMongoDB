# Node Callbacks To Promises With MongoDB

## Overview

This is a quick tutorial showing how I converted the [MongoDB Node.js Driver example](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native) from Node.js callbacks to Promises using [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).

To follow along, switch to the `promises` branch and follow the commits.

## Async

I also attempted to make an example using the [Async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async) library. That was less successful, the code became much more complex rather than simpler. This is likely due to a lack of experience with the library. Even so, you can see my attempt in the `async` branch.
